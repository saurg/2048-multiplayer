Description :  Our aim is to create a contest environment for 2048 game. We will follow the client server model, in which one computer is assigned as the server and all the clients connect to the server. The clients can play the game, and their status, scores etc. will be displayed/stored on the server. 

Requirements : 

1. Should be able to display a leaderboard of all currently active players.
2. User authentication for clients using username and password.
3. Crash recovery in case of sudden failure of network/computer/electricity.
4. User accounts should store the records of all games of that user.
5. Proper registration mechanism(with password recovery question)
6. Every activity of clients should be written to log with timestamps.
